## Description

Battheship game is a simple 2D android mobile game where user control a battleship on the center of the screen and shoots any incoming airplanes and submarines to get the highest possible score within the time limit.

I learned to build this project as part of my university's object-oriented programming project. I have learned to incorporate different design patterns such as Observer, Singleton, and Strategy Pattern while working on this project.
